### 👋 Hi, I'm Carl Shipley

I'm a Principal Technical Program Manager driving Azure Fundamentals across a portfolio of cloud services. While my day job centers on strategy and program delivery, I actively code and develop solutions using:

**Full-Stack Dashboard Development:**
- Python HTTP servers with dynamic query execution and real-time data visualization
- Interactive HTML/JavaScript dashboards with advanced filtering, sorting, and export capabilities
- Pluggable JSON configuration frameworks that enable rapid deployment of new monitoring scenarios
- Dynamic query loading systems that read configurations from file-based storage

**Advanced Data Engineering:**
- Complex Kusto (KQL) query development for multi-service risk analysis and operational insights
- Automated exception handling workflows that streamline compliance and remediation tracking
- JSON-based query templating systems that scale across diverse service portfolios
- Data transformation and HTML table generation for actionable business intelligence

**DevOps & Development Tools:**
- Git-based workflow management with branch strategies for dashboard releases
- AI-assisted development using GitHub Copilot for accelerated coding and debugging
- Batch automation scripts for one-click environment setup and dashboard deployment
- VS Code integration for enhanced development productivity

My GitHub activity includes private repositories where I build:
- Reusable dashboard frameworks with modular, file-based architecture
- Query libraries and configuration systems for operational analytics
- Python web applications that demonstrate modern development practices

My GitHub activity is mostly private due to the nature of my work, but I use this space to:
- Experiment with AI and Copilot in VS Code
- Build learning projects that strengthen my query and automation skills
- Explore ways to combine data, visualization, and automation for business impact
